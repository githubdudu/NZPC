The solution of problem O : https://zibada.guru/gcj/2009r2/problems/#B

I gave up problem O and P. The problem O was from Google Code Jam 2009 Round 2 (author: Mohamed Eldawy).

I put the only python solution into https://prog4fun.csse.canterbury.ac.nz/mod/quiz/view.php?id=4329. Can't get AC.

I test it locally and compared with my solution, it was much more slower than mine. (At least 10 times slower). 

Decision has been made. GIVE UP O and P.
